# .jules Directory

This directory contains configuration for Jules (Google's AI coding agent) to access remote hardware for testing.

## Files

- `hardware_connection.json` - Connection configuration for hardware access

## What This Enables

Jules can:
- ✅ Test code on real {PLATFORM} hardware
- ✅ Use Docker on actual hardware
- ✅ Access GPU for ML workloads (if available)
- ✅ Run performance benchmarks
- ✅ Test platform-specific features

## Usage

Jules automatically discovers this configuration. In your Jules prompt, mention:

```
I have hardware available at .jules/hardware_connection.json
```

Jules will then use the real hardware for testing instead of its VM.

## Security

- Connection uses SSH key authentication
- All activity is logged on the hardware
- Rate limited to prevent abuse
- You control when hardware is available (start/stop server)

## Monitoring

To see what Jules is doing on your hardware:
- Check `mcp-hardware-server.log` on your hardware
- Monitor system resources
- Review audit logs

## Setup

This was configured using the MCP Hardware Server. To update or reconfigure:
1. Run setup on your hardware
2. Copy the new `ai_agent_connection.json` here
3. Commit and push
