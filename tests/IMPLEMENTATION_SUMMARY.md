```

### Run Specific Categories
```bash
./tests/run-tests.sh docker     # Docker tests only
./tests/run-tests.sh ssh        # SSH tests only
./tests/run-tests.sh tunnel     # Tunnel tests only
./tests/run-tests.sh hardware   # Hardware tests only
./tests/run-tests.sh integration # Integration tests only
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
./tests/run-tests.sh -v docker container  # Verbose Docker container tests
./tests/run-tests.sh -t 60 integration    # Integration tests with 60s timeout
./tests/run-tests.sh --list                # List all available tests
```
